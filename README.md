# Iterated NDG simulation

The programming language is Racket.

This is a variation of code to simulate population playing iterated NDG.

The main file is ibar-1s.rkt.

It can trace out the replicator dynamics for the one shot NDG.

It can generate Mathematica code to draw the machine/automaton in Mathematica notebook.

It can generate Latex code of a payoff table.

It can export csv file.
